Jumpkicked out a goddamn window / and she wants to know if I'm going to replace it / did Alexander replace / the gordian knot?
The marsupials have us outnumbered, / or so they think, / their data comes largely from rural Australia / Most of our theories about the universe are kind of like this.
My friend says he has a lot to say about death. / Do I have a lot to say about anything? / Or am I just a kaleidoscope for the news?
I used to believe in most things. / Now I only believe in some.
Speed racer would've rather been a dentist / so he says in his belated memoir / written curmudgeonly / via voice recognition software by a  / semi-intelligent machine. / I always liked the idea of being close to people
Nighttime deals / in a different kind / of truth
If this were a camera / I'd have your address / by now
You don't need to swim  / in the most difficult river  / just to be one of the people  / that doesn't drown.
I hope I live forever  / until the earth is a black hole  / and I am the center of the block hole  / because at that point  / we are all the center of the black hole  / its nice isn't it  / all of us together  / democracy worked  / hooray.
we all want to be tethers / our hearts / infinitely elastic
what we lack / in reality / we make up for / in imagination
I read Mexican poetry / and drink bourbon alone / in my room, on the / nights when I am / alone in my room, / because I like to be / cool and it’s important / to be cool when no one / is watching because that’s / when it’s really authentic, / and besides / when people ask you  / the next day what you did  / last night you can say, / I read Mexican poetry / and drank bourbon and / they’ll say, / that’s cool.

The Boy and I / pack sand into the old cigar box / forming bricks. / We construct a wall / deconstruct a city / establish a fortress / and shatter its defenses / without a word.
